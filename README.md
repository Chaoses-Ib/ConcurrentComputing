# Concurrent Computing
<details><summary>Terminology</summary>

Concurrent vs simultaneous[^perfmatrix]:
- “concurrent” represents the events that occur over a period of time
- “simultaneous” represents the events that occur at a point in time

Concurrent, parallel vs distributed computing:
- Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which several computations are executed concurrently (during overlapping time periods) instead of sequentially (with one completing before the next starts)[^concurrent]
- Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously[^parallel]
- Distributed computing divides a single task between multiple computers to achieve a common goal[^pediaa]
